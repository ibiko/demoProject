# demoProject
Showcase Project

Demo Project for showing the possibilities of spring, spring-boot, H2 and swagger-io.
Using minimal effort it is possible to create a fully documented REST API which handles CRUD
operations to a H2 in memory DB. Using these libraries there is no need for writting any SQL or PL/SQL
to cover the basic CRUD operations.

Currently used technologies:
-H2
-spring-boot
-spring rest
-swagger-io
